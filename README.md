Title : The Student-Centered Platform for Knowledge, Connections, and Opportunities

Description : The Student Opportunities Hub is a web-based platform designed to address the common 
challenges faced by undergraduate students in discovering scholarships, internships, and 
participation opportunities. Many students struggle to access reliable information about available 
scholarships, nearby internships, and ongoing events or workshops, which often limits their 
academic growth and professional exposure. This project brings together all such opportunities 
into a single, student-friendly portal. The platform is divided into key sections: Scholarships, 
Internships, Clubs, Events, and Workshops. Each scholarship is displayed with its eligibility 
criteria, category (State, Central, or Private), and financial details. Internship listings allow filtering 
by type (full-time/part-time) and payment status (paid/unpaid), along with details like role, 
eligibility, duration, and perks. Clubs, events, and workshops include timing, eligibility, entry 
details, and location-based filters so that students can easily find opportunities nearby. Developed 
using HTML, CSS, Java, and JavaScript, the website provides an interactive and attractive 
interface for seamless navigation. By centralizing opportunities and making them easily accessible, 
this project helps students explore, participate, and enhance their academic and professional 
journey.
